        //Pakages are nothing but folders that acts as containers for classes. For instance the OOPs folder in which the code file is being created, acts as a pakage.

        //Next is creating classes within pakage. A simple way to do that is creating and defining new java files within any given folder(pakage).

        //Now next task is accessing classes and thier methods. Lets say I create a file in the directory Practice, with the name hello world.
        //helloWorld();
        //So when you will run the file you will see that it produces an error. Its because we havent imported the pakage in which this method belongs to. Once we do that, every thing will be fine.

        //Though this practice of accessing classes from other pakages works only when thier access is set to public and not private. More to be discussed later on.
